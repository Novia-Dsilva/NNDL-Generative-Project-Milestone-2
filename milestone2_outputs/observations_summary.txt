================================================================================

1. BASELINE CONDITIONAL GENERATION
   - Default parameters (CFG=7.5, 50 steps) produce consistent, high-quality results
   - Text encoder (CLIP) successfully captures semantic meaning
   - Image quality is photo-realistic across diverse prompts

2. CLASSIFIER-FREE GUIDANCE (CFG) FINDINGS
   
   CFG Scale 1.0-3.0:
   - Very creative but lacks prompt adherence
   - More artistic/abstract interpretations
   - Lower saturation and contrast
   
   CFG Scale 5.0-7.5: [OPTIMAL RANGE]
   - Best balance between creativity and prompt following
   - Natural-looking images with good detail
   - Recommended for most use cases
   
   CFG Scale 10.0-15.0:
   - Strong prompt adherence, sharp details
   - Can appear slightly over-processed
   - Good for specific/literal interpretations
   
   CFG Scale 20.0+:
   - Over-saturated, artificial appearance
   - Loss of natural texture
   - Not recommended for general use

3. NOISE SCHEDULER COMPARISON
   
   DDIM:
   - Reliable, consistent results
   - Good for predictable outputs
   - Slightly slower than others
   
   PNDM:
   - Smoother textures
   - Balanced quality/speed
   - Good general-purpose choice
   
   Euler:
   - Fast convergence
   - Good detail preservation
   - Slight variation in results
   
   DPM++ Multistep:
   - Best quality-to-speed ratio
   - Excellent for production use
   - Can achieve good results in 20-30 steps

4. KEY INSIGHTS
   - CFG scale has more impact on output quality than scheduler choice
   - DPM++ scheduler with CFG 7.5-10.0 offers best overall performance
   - Fewer steps (30-40) with DPM++ can match quality of 50 steps with DDIM
   - Complex prompts benefit from slightly higher CFG (8.0-10.0)
   - Simple prompts work well with lower CFG (5.0-7.0)

5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MILESTONE 3
   - Use DPM++ scheduler with CFG 8.5 as default
   - Consider prompt complexity when selecting CFG scale
   - Implement dynamic parameter selection based on prompt analysis
   - Explore LoRA fine-tuning for domain-specific improvements
